# Awesome Data Science 

*An open source Data Science repository to learn Data Science and solve real world problems.*




## Motivation

*This part is for dummies who are new to Data Science*

This is a shortcut path to start studying **Data Science**. Just follow the steps to answer the questions, "What is Data Science and what should I study to learn Data Science?"

First of all, Data Science is one of the hottest topics on the Computer and Internet farmland nowadays. People have gathered data from applications and systems until today and now is the time to analyze them. The next steps are producing suggestions from the data and creating predictions about the future. [Here](https://www.quora.com/Data-Science/What-is-data-science) you can find the biggest question for **Data Science** and hundreds of answers from experts. 

Secondly, Our favorite programming language is *Python* nowadays for #DataScience. Python's - [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) library has full functionality for collecting and analyzing data. We use Anaconda to play with data and to create applications.
